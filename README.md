# Classification Model using Neural Networks
## Introduction
This project involves creating a classification model based on neural network architecture. The model will be trained to classify flower species using the Iris dataset.

## Steps
1. **Dataset**
- The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which contains features related to iris flowers and their corresponding species.
2. **Data Preparation**
- Preprocess the dataset, including feature scaling and one-hot encoding for the target variable.
3. **Model Architecture**
- Implement a neural network model for multiclass classification.
- Choose an appropriate architecture with input, hidden, and output layers.
4. **Model Training**
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train the neural network model on the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set.
- Calculate relevant metrics for multiclass classification.
## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language for implementing neural network models.
- **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Library for machine learning models and tools.
